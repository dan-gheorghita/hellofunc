**Code Analysis: Printing Friendly Greetings**

This Python code defines a function named `hello()` that prints three different friendly greetings to the console. The function is then called three times to demonstrate its behavior.

**Function Breakdown:**

1.  The `hello()` function contains three `print()` statements:
    *   The first statement prints a friendly greeting: `'Howdy!'`.
    *   The second statement prints an enthusiastic version of the greeting: `'Howdy!!!'`.
    *   The third statement prints an alternative greeting: `'Hello there.'`.
2.  The function does not take any arguments and does not return any value.
3.  The function is called three times using the `hello()` function name, which executes the three `print()` statements each time.

**Behavioral Output:**

When the code is executed, the console will display the following output three times:

```
Howdy!
Howdy!!!
Hello there.
Howdy!
Howdy!!!
Hello there
